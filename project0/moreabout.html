               I have a passion for learning, and I love learning about new
               things. From the history of Rome, to new workout routines, to
               playing guitar, many things interest me.

               One of my favorite things to do is to simply relax and hang out
               with some of my friends and watch movies, play video games, or
               just talk. This helps me free my mind and I appreciate all the
               people I am surrounded by.

            <div class="col-sm" id="moreabout">
               Although I am interested in many things, I have always been drawn
               to acting and comedy, and have some desire to do some form of
               acting or writing skits one day.
