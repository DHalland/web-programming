# Project 0 - Dylan Halland

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project consists of four pages - a home page, an about page, a page for some fun memes, and another page with some more information about myself. Each page can be accessed via the Home page, and each page has a button that can take you back to the Home page. Each HTML file contains the necessary information for each page of my site, while I also have CSS/SCSS file that is used by all of these pages to add specific kinds of styling (along with Bootstrap usage).
